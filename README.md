# Data-Driven-Diabetes-Diagnosis-A-Project-Utilizing-Python-and-Tableau


This project utilizes a dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset includes various medical predictor variables such as the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, and more.

In the first week of the project, a descriptive analysis was performed to understand the variables and their corresponding values. Histograms were used to visually explore the variables and missing values were treated accordingly. A count plot was also created to describe the data types and the count of variables.

During the second week, the balance of the data was checked by plotting the count of outcomes by their value. Scatter charts were also created between pairs of variables to understand their relationships. Furthermore, correlation analysis was performed and visually explored using a heat map.

In the third week, strategies were devised for model building and the appropriate classification algorithm was applied to build a model. Various models were compared with the results from the KNN algorithm. The right validation framework was also decided upon and the thought process was expressed.

In the fourth and final week, a classification report was created to analyze sensitivity, specificity, AUC (ROC curve), etc. The report was descriptive to explain the values of these parameters that were used. A dashboard was also created in Tableau to provide a comprehensive visualization of the data. The dashboard included a pie chart to describe the diabetic or non-diabetic population, scatter charts between relevant variables to analyze relationships, histograms or frequency charts to analyze the distribution of data, a heatmap of correlation analysis among relevant variables, and bins of age values analyzed for different variables using a bubble chart.
